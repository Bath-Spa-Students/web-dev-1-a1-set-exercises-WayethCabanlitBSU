        <p>Laios Touden (ライオス・トーデン, Raiosu Tōden)
            A "tallman" (トールマン, tōruman), or human, who, along with his party, ventures into a dungeon to rescue his sister Falin before the dragon that defeated them digests her. 
            He is a strong fighter and the leader of the party, and is calm and gentle. 
            However, he tends to speak quickly when excited and can be tactless. He is excited to try different monster meals, and often uses the knowledge gained from cooking monsters to develop techniques to defeat</p>

        <h4>  Voiced by: Sayaka Senbongi (Japanese); Emily Rudd (English) </h4>
        <p>A cautious half-elf magician and an original member of Laios' party, who wields a wooden staff and can use various forms of magic. She is usually hesitant and even sometimes unwilling to eat monsters.
